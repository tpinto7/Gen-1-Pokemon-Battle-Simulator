# Pokemon Generation 1 Simulator
Out of nostalgia, I recreated the wonders of Pokemon gen 1! The game is text and console based and is written in C#. Moves are chosen each turn, and players battle until their Pokemon faint.

Pokemon include legendaries such as Mewtwo, Mew, and Articuno, and range from the mighty Magikarp to the ghastly Gengar. Each Pokemon has unique features, including their type, skill set and move set.
